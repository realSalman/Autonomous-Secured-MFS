/**
 * Demo rules seed — paired with `data/demo/sample-transactions.json` so
 * that `npm run demo:load` produces a visible ACCEPT / REVIEW / DECLINE
 * split in the Sentinel dashboard out of the box, even on a fresh
 * deployment with no PAA cache or Redis feature data.
 *
 * The four rules below use only the core PredictRequestDto fields
 * (amount, transaction_type, segment) that the rules engine has
 * unconditional access to — they don't depend on Redis-stored
 * features. Production users would replace these with their own
 * tenant-specific business rules.
 *
 * Seeded INACTIVE unless SEED_DEMO_RULES_ACTIVE=true: the amount
 * thresholds are demo-dataset props, not market-reviewed values, and
 * left active they dominate real traffic (declining every txn >= 100k
 * and reviewing every 500-10k PAYMENT) while shadowing the FATF pack
 * — measured in efficacy-validation/report.md (finding F2). Activate
 * them for the demo dataset via the env var or per-rule in Sentinel.
 *
 * Idempotent: each rule is keyed by `name`; running the seed twice
 * does not duplicate rows, and existing rows keep whatever isActive
 * state an operator set.
